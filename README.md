Liam's Machine Learning Stuff
=============================

Why I wrote this
----------------

After taking Andrew Ng's machine learning class (ml-class.org) I got excited about putting the ideas
into practice. I put this repo together to hold a collection of scripts to help me build systems
that can learn.

So far I have an implementation of an artificial neural network. I started out with the ANN because
I was very impressed with how well it worked to recognize digits in one of our class assignments, but 
unfortunately a lot of it went over my head and we really only had to do the "forward propagation" 
part and so I was still confused about how it worked. I created ann.py to help me understand how the
ANN works as well as to have it around for future use.

Why I'm proud of it
-------------------

Using Andrew Ng's notes and ch.4 of Programming Collective Intellegence to put this together I feel 
like I have a pretty good understanding of how ANNs work now and how to use them successfully.  

It actually works and I think it is a pretty clean implementation compared to some others I have seen.
I decided to use numpy heavily for doing the linear algebra instead of a ton of loops. But of course
there is plenty of room for improvement. I think the project is cool and an exciting change from the 
usual CRUD apps I've done in the past.
